- **Maintenance Mode**:
  - `make`: Load data from an attachment ID and metadata.
  - `blueprint`: Define expected media sizes.
  - `verify`: Check and validate existing metadata.
  - `save`: Merge verified data with metadata and save to the database.

- **Production Mode**:
  - `make`: Load data from an attachment ID and metadata.
  - `verify`: Skip verification and check metadata for rendering.
  - A suite of methods for generating final output markup.

### Media Config

The `MediaConfig` class is responsible for managing media size configurations. It includes settings like image dimensions, breakpoints, and optional image variations.

### Media Rendering

The `MediaRender` class handles the rendering of media files based on their configurations. It can be used to dynamically generate responsive images.

### Media Compression

The `MediaCompression` class provides methods for compressing media files to reduce file sizes while maintaining quality.

### Media Metadata

The `MediaMetadata` class helps manage metadata associated with media files, ensuring it is up-to-date and accurate.

These classes handle asynchronous processing of media-related tasks, making it efficient to perform bulk operations.
